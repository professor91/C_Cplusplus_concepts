C++ provides a list of standard exceptions defined in <exception>
These are arranged in a parent-child hierarchy

    -->std:exception
    |
    |
    |-- std::bad_alloc          |-- std::domain_error
    |   (thrown by new)         |   (when a mathematically invalid domain is used)
    |                           |
    |-- std::bad_cast           |-- std::invalid_argument
    |   (by dynamic_cast)       |   (due to invalid argument)
    |                           |
    |-- std::bad_typeid         |-- std::length_error
    |   (by typeid)             |   (when a too big std::string is created)
    |                           |
    |-- std::bad_exception      |-- std::out_of_range
    |   (unexpected exception)  |   (thrown by 'at' method)
    |                           |
    |-- std::logic_failure   <----
    |   (theoritically can be detected by reading code)
    |
    |-- std::runtime_error   <----
        (cannot be detected     |-- std::overflow_error
        by reading the code     |   (thrown if mathematical overflow occurs)
                                |
                                |-- std::range_error
                                |   (when you try to store a value which is out of range)
                                |
                                |-- std::underflow_error
                                    (if a mathematical underflow occurs)

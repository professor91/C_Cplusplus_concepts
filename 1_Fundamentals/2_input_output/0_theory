C++ provides both the formatted and unformatted IO functions. 
In formatted or high-level IO, bytes are grouped and converted to types such as int, double, string or 
user-defined types. 
In unformatted or low-level IO, bytes are treated as raw bytes and unconverted. 

Formatted IO operations are supported via overloading the 
stream insertion (<<) and stream extraction (>>) operators, 
which presents a consistent public IO interface.
